## application_scorecard
The Application Scorecard Model is designed to evaluate and score incoming applications based on certain criteria or features. This model can be used to make informed decisions, such as whether to approve or decline an application for a specific purpose, such as loans, credit cards, or job applications.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an application scorecard model that can effectively assess applications and provide a numeric score indicating the likelihood of approval or success. The model leverages historical data and relevant features to make predictions.
